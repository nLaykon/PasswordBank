PasswordBank using Python, sqlite & cryptography.

GenPass.py will auto generate a database to store encrypted passwords locally. it can generate passwords with choosable length.

ReadPass.py will pull the encrypted passwords from the database, decrypt them and dump them to a terminal.

If you have a way to improve this and or make it more secure, open an Improvement in the Issues section and i'll try to add it.




ToDo: 

Add a GUI to interact with the scripts instead of Commandline
